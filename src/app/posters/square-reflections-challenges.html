		<p>This is a set of simple visual puzzles from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/beautiful-symmetry" target="_blank" style='font-style: italic; display: inline-block;'>Beautiful Symmetry: A Coloring Book About Math</a>.  You can work them out in your head or get a boost by sketching them out on paper.</p>
		<p>Here is a square with lines breaking it into equal segments:</p>
		<div class="text-content-graphic line">
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas small'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true}'
                options='{}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>
        <p>Squares have symmetries such as mirror reflections, which these puzzles are about. We can reflect the square across any of the lines that break it into segments, such as this horizontal line:</p>
        <div class="text-content-graphic line">
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas small'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true}'
                options='{"mirrorLines":[0,0,1,0], "margin":15}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>
        <p>Or the vertical line or diagonal lines,</p>
        <div class="text-content-graphic line">
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true}'
                options='{"mirrorLines":1, "margin":30}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true}'
                options='{"mirrorLines":[0,0,0,1], "margin":30}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true}'
                options='{"mirrorLines":[0,1,0,0], "margin":30}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>
        <p>And each segment of the square lands on an identical segment and the square is visually unchanged.  For this reason, we'll call these lines "mirror lines".</p>
        <p>However, we can use color to take away these mirrors.  I can color the square with two colors <span style="display: inline-block;">(green and white)</span> as</p>
		<div class="text-content-graphic line">
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas small'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true, "coloring": [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1]}'
                options='{}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>
        <p>So now the only mirror line is the vertical mirror line.  See, I can reflect the square across the vertical mirror and it will remain unchanged.  Each segment lands on an identical segment with the same color.</p>

        <div class="text-content-graphic line">
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true}'
                options='{"mirrorLines":1, "margin":30}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
            <p class="text">:</p>
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas small'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true, "coloring": [0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1]}'
                options='{}'

                options='{}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>

        <p>But if I reflect it across the horizontal line or a diagonal line then the square is visually changed because the colored segments do not land on identically colored segments.</p>

        <p>There are other ways to color the square for the same effect, such as:</p>
        <div class="text-content-graphic line">
            <canvas-centered-drawing

	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>
        <p>So that once again the only mirror line of the square is the vertical mirror line.</p>

        <h2>Puzzle 1</h2>

        <p>How many different ways can you color the square with two colors so that the <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> mirror line is the horizontal mirror line?</p>

        <div class="text-content-graphic line">
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true}'
                options='{"mirrorLines":[0,0,1,0], "margin":30}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>
        <p>Here is one way:</p>

        <div class="text-content-graphic line">
            <canvas-centered-drawing
            	class='canvas small'
                draw-function='drawRegularPolygon'
                function-options='{"N": 4, "withMirrorSections": true, "coloring": [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]}'
                options='{}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>
        <p>Now find <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of the ways and count them.*</p>

        <p>Careful: This way cannot count because there is also a vertical mirror line:</p>

        <div class="text-content-graphic line">
            <canvas-centered-drawing

                options='{}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>

        <p>*Note: When counting the ways to color, do not count again when the colors are simply swapped. i.e. These two colorings must be counted only once:</p>
        <div class="text-content-graphic line">

                options='{}'
	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <h2>Puzzle 2</h2>

        <p>How many ways can you color the square with two colors so that the only mirror line is this diagonal mirror?</p>

	        ></canvas-centered-drawing>
        </div> 
        <p>Here is one way:</p>

        </div>
        <p>Now find and count the others.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <h2>Puzzle 3</h2>
        <p>How many ways can you color the square with two colors so that it has both horizontal and vertical mirror lines, but no diagonal mirror lines?</p>
