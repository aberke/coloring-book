    <h3>What This “Book” Is And Is About</h3>

    <p>This is a “coloring book about math” that is both digital and on paper.</p>
    <p>It is a playful book.  The mathematical concepts it presents show themselves in illustrations that can be colored on paper or animated and regenerated by interacting with them on the web version.  Throughout the book there are thought challenges and coloring challenges to further engage the reader in puzzling over the content.</p>

	<p>The book is about symmetry.  It uses group theory as the mathematical foundation to discuss its content while heavily relying on visuals to communicate the concepts.</p>

	<p>Group theory and other mathematical studies of symmetry are traditionally covered in college level or higher courses.  This is unfortunate because these are the most exciting parts of mathematics and they can be introduced with language that is visual, and with words that avoid jargon.  Such an introduction is the intention of this “book”.</p>
